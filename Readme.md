#What is Angora for?

Angora is a stack of packages for data scientist like me. Most of the packages are high level wrapper for python standard library or popular third party extension. Why I create this? Because, I want my code more reusable, and I don't want writing ugly but necessary code interrupt me from thinking and designing wonderful functionality.

Because my Chinese Zodiac Character is rabbit, so I love Angora Rabbit the most for no reason. That's why I want to call this project Angora.
